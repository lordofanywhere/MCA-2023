# Music Curation and Analytics

## Task 2
### Identify a piece of music, download the PDF and then convert it to MuseScore. Edit at least 10 bars in MuseScore.

For this task, I identified the song _When You Were Young_. This was the lead single from the band's second album, _Sam's Town_ (2006), and it remains incredibly popular amongst fans to this day, with 555,066,098 streams recorded by Spotify as of October 25th, 2023.

This arrangement is for Piano, Vocal and Guitar, and it is in key B Major.

Below are the first two pages from the original music sheets, and my review and/or transcription of the first 17 bars:
