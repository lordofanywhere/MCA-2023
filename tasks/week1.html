		<h1>Week 1: Basics of Music Data</h1>
			
			<h2>Task 1: Identify a theme for your dataset</h2>
				<p>The theme I have chosen is the band The Killers. The were formed in 2001 in Las Vegas, Nevada (United States). The band currently consists of four members: Brandon Flowers (lead vocals, keyboard), Dave Keuning (lead guitar, backing vocals), Mark Stoermer (bass, rhythm guitar, backing vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion).¹ The Killers have released seven studio albums to date: their debut <cite>Hot Fuss</cite> (2004), <cite>Sam's Town</cite> (2006), <cite>Day & Age</cite>  (2008), <cite>Battle Born</cite> (2012), <cite>Wonderful Wonderful</cite> (2017), <cite>Imploding the Mirage</cite> (2020), and <cite>Pressure Machine</cite> (2021). They have also released one live album, <cite>Live from the Royal Albert Hall</cite>, recorded in London and released in 2009, and three compilation albums: <cite>Sawdust</cite> (2007), <cite>Direct Hits</cite> (2013), and the Christmas compilation <cite>Don't Waste Your Wishes</cite> (2016).² In November 2020, The Killers had sold 28 million albums worldwide.³</p>
				<p>I have chosen The Killers as my dataset theme because, ever since I heard their hits <cite>Somebody told me</cite> and <cite>Mr. Brightside</cite>, I have been a fan of the band. I have had the opportunity to see their musical growth throughout the years and how they have experimented with song arrangements on different performances, remixes and re-recordings. I am familiar with their catalogue, and I would like to embrace the opportunity of discovering a new perspective of their music through analysing their music and music data.</p>

			<h2>Task 2: Dataset Challenges</h2>
				<h3>Based on your own experience, what do you think are some challenges to working with music and music-related data (perhaps related to access, curation, distribution, etc.)? How does your selected theme display some of these challenges? Describe the current manifestations of data relating to your selected theme, discussing how it is presently curated (collected and gathered) and how it is presented, described, and analysed.</h3>
					<p>Some of the challenges surrounding working with music data relate specifically to metadata. There is no standardised way format for metadata.</p>
					<p>Some artists may share the same name as other artists, who may make wildly different music. This can create retrievability issues and even confusion: when trying to access the music of one of these artists, they may retrieve the artists' namesake music instead. While Discogs has records for 9 bands named "The Killers", in addition to a band named "Killers" and another named "Los Killers", it is unlikely that people looking to retrieve music by the band I have chosen will access someone else's music by accident, as currently they seem to have a much bigger streaming base (as reported by Spotify). However, this may be an issue for those looking to retrieve music from any of the 10 other artists that share the same name, which may be more difficult to access.</p>
				
			<h2>Current Manifestations of Data</h2>
				<h3>Descriptive Data</h3>
					<p>Disappointingly, the band's <a href="https://thekillersmusic.com">official website</a> does not offer a way of browsing the band's releases in chronological order or by release type. However, the 'Music' section of the website does offer a comprehensive collection of the band's releases, which includes albums, compilations, EPs and singles, including singles only released digitally. Descriptive data is not provided for any release on this section.</p>
					<p>On the band's official website, the only place where minimal descriptive data is provided in on the <a href="https://shopuk.thekillersmusic.com/?utm_source=Original&utm_campaign=20210718&utm_medium=channel.utm_medium&utm_referrer=direct&utm_board=island-records-us&utm_country=US&utm_linkurl=TheKillers.lnk.to%2FPMStore&lf=457ac199c1cfba34fb9d302ef411593a">Merch</a> section, which has a 'Music' category. However, the only descriptive data provided here are the <em>format</em> of the releases on sale and the <em>label</em> where they were released.</p>
					<p>The Killers' music is available in most streaming platforms, including Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal and Deezer. However, while all platforms show album name, release year, label (except for Tidal) and track duration, the display of other descriptive data varies across platforms. For the same song, <cite>When You Were Young</cite>, Deezer shows only <em>composer</em>, while Spotify shows <em>writer(s)</em>, <em>performer</em> (crediting 'The Killers'), and <em>producer</em> for the track. Apple Music provides the most information out of all the services compared, showing <em>lyrics</em>, <em>performing artists</em> (individually crediting each band member), individuals responsible for <em>composition & lyrics</em>, and <em>production & engineering</em>, individually listing each role. Tidal, in contrast, does not provide any additional credits, at least on the limited web player provided to non-users.</p>
					<p>Both Spotify and Apple Music record song plays and the likes these songs receive, and then categorise and organise these data in order to make decisions that result in recommending similar songs, albums or artists to users. I presume that Deezer and Tidal offer similar features, although I am not very familiar with these services.</p>
				<h3>Notated Data</h3>
					<p>Due to The Killers' popularity, it is not hard to find sheet music for most of their releases. As of October 25, there are 136 music sheets in <a href="https://musescore.com/artist/the_killers-133583">Musescore.com</a>. I tried locating music sheets for two of the band's most obscure songs, <cite>Why Do I Keep Counting?</cite>, and <cite>Andy, You're a Star</cite>, and these were available for sale on <a href="https://www.sheetmusicnow.com/">Sheet Music Now</a> and <a href="https://freshsheetmusic.com/">Fresh Sheet Music</a>.
				<h3>Acoustic Data</h3>
					<p>The Killers' music is widely available in streaming platforms, and it can also be found in YouTube, where the band has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkhyoTaWKuB-Rdbb6Z3Z5DA">channel<a>. The band's website also features their music videos, as well as some live videos and 'visualiser' videos (track audios accompanied by simple visuals created for the video) in their website, under the 'Videos' section.</p>
