# Music Curation and Analytics

## Task 3
### Export the score you created last week to MusicXML and MEI. Then render your MEI file using Verovio in GitHub.

### In the space provided on the verovio.html page, compare 3 elements in the MusicXML file to the corresponding ones in MEI. For help, look at the MusicXML documentation (https://www.w3.org/2021/06/musicxml40/) and the MEI documentation (https://music-encoding.org/guidelines/v4/content/). Think about: which attributes can be employed in each standard, which parents and children can be used, and try to think of the implications of these differences.
