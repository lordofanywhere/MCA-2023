## Task 1: Theme
**Identify a theme for your dataset**

The theme I have chosen is the band The Killers. The were formed in 2001 in Las Vegas, Nevada (United States). The band currently consists of four members: Brandon Flowers (lead vocals, keyboard), Dave Keuning (lead guitar, backing vocals), Mark Stoermer (bass, rhythm guitar, backing vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion). The Killers have released seven studio albums to date: their debut _Hot Fuss_ (2004), _Sam's Town_ (2006), _Day & Age_  (2008), _Battle Born_ (2012), _Wonderful Wonderful_ (2017), _Imploding the Mirage_ (2020), and _Pressure Machine_ (2021). They have also released one live album, _Live from the Royal Albert Hall_, recorded in London and released in 2009, and three compilation albums: _Sawdust_ (2007), _Direct Hits_ (2013), and the compiulation of Christmas singles _Don't Waste Your Wishes_ (2016).


## Task 2: Challenges
**Based on your own experience, what do you think are some challenges to working with music and music-related data (perhaps related to access, curation, distribution, etc.)? How does your selected theme display some of these challenges? Describe the current manifestations of data relating to your selected theme, discussing how it is presently curated (collected and gathered) and how it is presented, described, and analysed.**

Some of the challenges surrounding working with music data relate specifically to metadata.
There is no standardised way format for medatada.

Some artists may share the same name as other artists, who may make wildly different music. This can create retrievability issues and even confusion: when trying to access the music of one of these artists, they may retrieve the artists' namesake music instead. While Discogs has records for 9 bands named "The Killers", in addition to a band named "Killers" and another named "Los Killers", it is unlikely that people looking to retrieve music by the band I have chosen will access someone else's music by accident, as currently they seem to have a much bigger streaming base (as reported by Spotify). However, this may be an issue for those looking to retrieve music from any of the 10 other artists that share the same name, which may be more difficult to access.
